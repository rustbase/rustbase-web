# DustData Internals

This section describes the internals of the DustData library. It is not necessary to understand this section to use the
library. The DustData is seperated into five parts: Memtable, SSTable, Index, Filter and Logs.

## Memtable

Memtable is a temporary storage for the data that is not yet flushed to disk. If Memtable reaches a certain size, it is
flushed to disk and a new Memtable is created. The Memtable is implemented as a Binary Tree.

## SSTable

SSTable is a sorted table on disk. It is a file that contains the data that is flushed from Memtable. The data is sorted
by key. The SSTable is implemented as a Binary Tree.

## Index

Index is a file that contains the index of the SSTable. It is a file that contains the offset of the key in the SSTable.

## Filter

Filter is a file that contains the bloom filter of the SSTable. It is a file that contains the bloom filter of the keys in
the SSTable.

## Logs

Logs is a file that contains the logs of the SSTable. It is a file that contains the logs of the SSTable.
