# How it works?

DustData is the core of Rustbase. It manage all the database data.

There is 4 main parts in DustData:

-   **SSTable**
-   **Memtable**
-   **Index**
-   **Filter**

## Memtable

Basically, Memtable is a simple Binary Tree. It's the first place where data is stored. When the Memtable reach in a certain size, it's flushed to a SSTable.

## SSTable

SSTable or Sorted String Table is a file that contains data. It's a file that contains data sorted by key. It's a file that contains data sorted by key. It's the main storage of Rustbase.

## Index

Indexing is the important part of the DustData. The index is a list that contains all the keys of the SSTable and the address of the value. It's used to find the key in the SSTable.

## Filter

Sometimes, we don't need to read all the SSTable to find a key. For example, if we want to find the key "hello", we don't need to read all the SSTable. We can use the filter to find the key. The filter is a list that contains all the keys of the SSTable. It's used to find the key in the SSTable.
