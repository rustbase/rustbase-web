# Introduction

This document provides a overview of how to use RBQL (Rustbase Query Language) to query Rustbase. RBQL is not a SQL-like, so it is not a replacement for SQL. However, it is a very powerful tool for querying Rustbase. It is also very easy to learn and use. This document is intended to be a quick start guide for using RBQL.

## Concepts

Rustbase is a key-value database, you can separe data into a `databases`. If you insert a new data into a database, the database will be created automatically.

### Switching databases in Rustbase CLI

To switch databases in Rustbase CLI, you can use the `!database` command. For example, if you want to switch to the `test` database, you can use the following command:

```
!database users
```

## Inserting data

You can insert data into a database by using the `insert` command. The `insert` command takes two arguments, the first argument is the data you want to insert, and then a `in` keyword, and then the key. The key must be unique and cannot be empty. The data can be any type of data, but it must be a valid JSON string.

```
insert {"name": "John", "age": 20} in user:1
```

## Getting data

You can get a value with the key by using the `get` command. The `get` command takes one argument, the key. The key must be unique and cannot be empty.

```
get user:1
```

## Updating data

You can update a value with the key by using the `update` command. The `update` command takes two arguments, the first argument is the data you want to update, and then a `in` keyword, and then the key.

```
update {"name": "Joe Mamma", "age": 21} in user:1
```

## Deleting data

To delete a value, you can use `delete`. The `delete` command takes one argument, the key. The key cannot be empty.

```
delete user:1
```

## Deleting database

To delete a database you can use `delete` keyword followed by `database` keyword, and then the database name. The database name cannot be empty.

```
delete database users
```

## Listing databases

To list all keys in database, you can use the `list` keyword followed by `databases` keyword. The `list` keyword had a optional argument that is the database name. If you don't specify the database name, it will list all databases.

```
list
```

or

```
list passwords <- Another database
```

## Alias

On RBQL you can use alias to make your query more shorter. For example, if you want delete a database you can use `del` instead of `delete` or `db` instead of `database`.

```
del db users
```

### All aliases

-   `del` instead of `delete`
-   `db` instead of `database`
-   `upd` instead of `update`
-   `ls` instead of `list`
