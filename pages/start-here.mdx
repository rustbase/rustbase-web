## What is Rustbase?

Rustbase is a open-source key-value NoSQL database that focus on lightweight, high performance and easy to use. It is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and use [DustData](https://github.com/rustbase/dustdata) as storage engine.
We use [bson](https://bsonspec.org/) as data format.

## Why Rustbase?

> So... why Rustbase? There are many key-value databases out there, why should you use Rustbase?

Here are some reasons:

-   **Lightweight** - Rustbase is a lightweight database, it is easy to use and easy to deploy.
-   **High Performance** - Rustbase is a high performance database, it can handle a lot of requests per second.
-   **Easy to Use** - Rustbase is easy to use, it is easy to deploy and easy to use.

We use gRPC as the communication protocol, so you can use any language to connect to Rustbase.
